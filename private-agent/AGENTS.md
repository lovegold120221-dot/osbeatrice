# AGENTS.md

Guidance for OpenCode sessions working in this repo. Beatrice OS is a Flutter
**Android-only** app (no iOS) that drives on-device automation via an LLM-guided
Accessibility Service. Package: `ai.eburon.beatrice`. Firebase is wired via
`com.google.gms.google-services` (config in `android/app/google-services.json`,
gitignored). This repo is one half of OSBeatrice; the sibling web app lives in
`../Beatrice-Voice`.

## Commands

- `flutter pub get` — resolve deps (run after cloning or changing pubspec).
- `flutter test` — runs the suite (only `test/ai_service_test.dart`; pure-Dart
  unit tests on `AiService` static methods). This is what CI runs.
- `flutter analyze` — lint via `flutter_lints` (`analysis_options.yaml`). **Not
  enforced in CI.** `print()` calls in services are used as lightweight logging;
  there are exactly 14 — don't treat them as bugs to fix.
- `flutter build apk --release` — universal APK. Add `--split-per-abi` for
  per-architecture APKs (`arm64-v8a` / `armeabi-v7a` / `x86_64`).
- `dart run flutter_launcher_icons` — regenerate `ic_launcher` from
  `assets/app-logo.png` (config lives in `pubspec.yaml`).

Toolchain: Flutter stable (SDK ^3.10.3), Java/Kotlin 17, compileSdk 37,
Android minSdk 26. Release builds sign with **debug keys** (see
`android/app/build.gradle.kts` TODO) — no keystore is configured.

## Architecture

Two Flutter entry points in `lib/main.dart`:
- `main()` — the app (`BeatriceOSApp` → `OnboardingScreen` or `HomeScreen`).
- `overlayMain()` (`@pragma("vm:entry-point")`) — the floating overlay UI
  (`lib/overlay_main.dart`). **Disabled** behind
  `FeatureFlags.floatingOverlayEnabled = false`
  (`lib/config/feature_flags.dart`); the implementation is retained but inert.
  Do not re-enable without stabilizing it.

Core automation loop: `AiService` (LLM, OpenAI-compatible chat completions) →
`ActionHandler` dispatches simple actions, or `TaskExecutor` runs multi-step
`execute_task` → `ScreenAutomationService` dumps the accessibility tree +
performs gestures via a native MethodChannel → LLM reads the screen dump →
repeats until `done`. `RecoveryEngine` handles stuck states;
`SkillMemoryService` persists learned skills as JSONL.

On-device vision: `VisionService` (`lib/services/vision_service.dart`) runs
YOLO26n (320×320) via `onnxruntime` on screenshots to spot UI elements the
accessibility tree can't see (games, image-heavy apps). It's hooked into
`ScreenAutomationService` and fails silently if the model isn't loaded.
**`assets/yolo26n.onnx` is not in the repo right now** — only
`coco_labels.txt` is present — so the vision path degrades to no-op without
crashing. The `onnxruntime` native dep noticeably slows clean builds.

AGENTS.md / ROADMAP.md: the repo is migrating toward a structured skill
protocol (`ROADMAP.md`); Phase 1 (agent identity via `AgentIdentityService`,
device profile, secure owner-agent binding) is done. Read `ROADMAP.md` before
touching identity/binding code.

## Native bridge (read before touching native code)

The real native bridge is the hand-rolled MethodChannel
`ai.eburon.beatrice/accessibility`, registered in
`android/app/src/main/kotlin/ai/eburon/beatrice/MainActivity.kt`
(`registerAccessibilityChannel`), plus the EventChannel
`ai.eburon.beatrice/accessibility_events` streaming accessibility events via
`AgentAccessibilityService.eventListener`. The channel is also registered on a
cached background engine named `myCachedEngine` via `BackgroundEngineReceiver`
(broadcast action `ai.eburon.beatrice.REGISTER_BACKGROUND_CHANNELS`).

`AgentAccessibilityService.kt` is the AccessibilityService singleton (`instance`)
implementing `dumpScreen`, `clickAtCoordinates`, `typeText`, `scroll`, `swipe`,
`pressBack/Home`, `takeScreenshot` (Android 11+ / API 30+ only), plus
`getDeviceProfile` / `getCurrentPackage` handled in `MainActivity`. Dart side:
`lib/services/screen_automation_service.dart` (3s channel timeout).

**`local_plugins/agent_native` is a stub and is NOT wired into the app** —
absent from `pubspec.yaml`/`pubspec.lock` and never imported in `lib/`. It only
implements `getPlatformVersion`. Do not assume it is the native bridge.

**`local_plugins/flutter_overlay_window` IS wired** via `dependency_overrides`
(path override in `pubspec.yaml`). It is a vendored fork — edit it in place;
changes affect the build directly.

## AI providers

Default endpoint is **not a raw model API**: `AiService.taskApiUrl`
(`https://osbeatrice.vercel.app/task_api`) is the Beatrice-Voice server
gateway. Requests send `X-Beatrice-Device-Id` (canonical `agentId`) and
`Authorization: Bearer <Firebase id token>`; **the app never sends an AI
provider key in this mode**, a fresh Firebase sign-in is required
(`isConfigured` is satisfied by task-API mode). Default model is
`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`. A manually-configured `api_base_url` (Settings) drops
into direct OpenAI-compatible mode (`/chat/completions` + `Authorization:
Bearer <key>`); the API key is pre-filled at runtime from the gitignored
asset `assets/local_config/ai_test_config.json` when no key is saved.

Special NVIDIA NIM handling (`https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`):
`AiService.nvidiaFreeChatModels` is an allowlist intersected with the live
`/models` response, so unavailable or non-chat models never appear in the
picker. Default NVIDIA model: `z-ai/glm-5.2` (a reasoning model — the service
forces ≥4096 max tokens for it). All settings live in SharedPreferences under
`api_*` / `telegram_*` keys (see `AiService.init`).

## Quirks

- LLM JSON responses can be truncated. `AiService.parseActionFromResponse` and
  `TaskExecutor` strip markdown fences and **append closing braces** when
  `jsonDecode` fails with "Unexpected end of input" (common with free/local
  models). `test_parse.dart` at the repo root is a scratch experiment for this
  — not part of the test suite and not run by `flutter test`.
- `.gitignore` excludes `*.py` and `*.jsonl` (legacy training pipeline). Don't
  add Python/JSONL files expecting them tracked. `/assets/local_config/ai_test_config.json`
  is gitignored (developer-local only); `assets/local_config/.gitkeep` keeps
  the directory.
- CI (`.github/workflows/android-release.yml`, inside this repo's own
  `.github/`) triggers on `v*` tags or manual dispatch. It runs
  `flutter pub get` → `flutter test` → builds universal + split APKs → uploads
  artifacts. It does **not** publish to GitHub Releases or run `flutter analyze`.
- `android/.../Test.kt` is a throwaway scratch file (imports
  `AccessibilityNodeInfo`); ignore it.
